//get a reference to the calculate button

//get a reference to the billTotal element

//get a reference to the billString

//create the function that will be called when the calculate button is pressed

//  * loop over all the entries in the the resulting list
//  * check if it is a call or an sms and add the right amount to the overall total
//  * once done looping over all the entries - display the total onto the screen in the billTotal element
